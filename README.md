# Timed Quiz
## Description

The motive of this project was to create a multiple choice timed quiz that allowed the user to save their score into a local store, with the ability to compare high scores. When the user clicks the start quiz button, the prompt will disappear and the first question appears, with answer choices. The time starts once the start button starts. If the user gets an answer wrong, the time will subtract by 10. If the user gets an answer right, the score will increment. Add the end of the quiz, the application will display your score based on your correct answers and your time left. The application stores your score into a local store, and allows you to type your initials with your score to save it, and then take the quiz again. You can see the highscores displayed on the screen in order from the highest to the lowest. The user also has the option to clear the highscores from the storage.

The timer starts when the button is clicked, and then the score starts to keep count based on the users correct choices, and the time that is remaining.
